< 🔭 I'm a college student now.>
  :I am a computer science student. I'm currently studying hard every day with the goal of creating a web app. There are a lot of things that I lack, but I'm trying to do my best.

< 🌱 I'm learning at the front end.>
  :I am currently studying React and JavaScript. I want to be a front-end engineer who handles it skillfully someday.

<👯 Let's work hard on the collaboration.>
  :I will always make a web app that can help others. I once made a web to help the elderly as a team project. This experience is a very special experience for me, and I want to keep making these experiences with other people.
